        <P>PGN is "Portable Game Notation", a standard designed for the
          representation of chess game data using ASCII text files. PGN is structured for
          easy reading and writing by human users and for easy parsing and generation by
          computer programs. The intent of the definition and propagation of PGN is to
          facilitate the sharing of public domain chess game data among chessplayers
          (both organic and otherwise), publishers, and computer chess researchers
          throughout the world.</P>
        <P>PGN is not intended to be a general purpose standard that is
          suitable for every possible use; no such standard could fill all conceivable
          requirements. Instead, PGN is proposed as a universal portable representation
          for data interchange. The idea is to allow the construction of a family of
          chess applications that can quickly and easily process chess game data using
          PGN for import and export among themselves.</P></DIV>
      <DIV CLASS="chapter"><HR>
        <H1><A NAME="c2">2: Chess data representation</A></H1>
        <P>Computer usage among chessplayers has become quite common in recent
          years and a variety of different programs, both commercial and public domain,
          are used to generate, access, and propagate chess game data. Some of these
          programs are rather impressive; most are now well behaved in that they
          correctly follow the Laws of Chess and handle users' data with reasonable care.
          Unfortunately, many programs have had serious problems with several aspects of
          the external representation of chess game data. Sometimes these problems become
          more visible when a user attempts to move significant quantities of data from
          one program to another; if there has been no real effort to ensure portability
          of data, then the chances for a successful transfer are small at best.</P>

          <H1 CLASS="sect1"><A NAME="c2.1">2.1: Data interchange
            incompatibility</A></H1>
          <P>The reasons for format incompatibility are easy to understand. In
            fact, most of them are correlated with the same problems that have already been
            seen with commercial software offerings for other domains such as word
            processing, spreadsheets, fonts, and graphics. Sometimes a manufacturer
            deliberately designs a data format using encryption or some other secret,
            proprietary technique to "lock in" a customer. Sometimes a designer may produce
            a format that can be deciphered without too much difficulty, but at the same
            time publicly discourage third party software by claiming trade secret
            protection. Another software producer may develop a non-proprietary system, but
            it may work well only within the scope of a single program or application
            because it is not easily expandable. Finally, some other software may work very
            well for many purposes, but it uses symbols and language not easily understood
            by people or computers available to those outside the country of its
            development.</P></DIV>

          <P>A specification for a portable game notation must observe the
            lessons of history and be able to handle probable needs of the future. The
            design criteria for PGN were selected to meet these needs. These criteria
            include:</P>

          <OL TYPE="1">
            <LI>
              <P>The details of the system must be publicly available and free
                of unnecessary complexity. Ideally, if the documentation is not available for
                some reason, typical chess software developers and users should be able to
                understand most of the data without the need for third party
                assistance.</P></LI>
            <LI>
              <P>The details of the system must be non-proprietary so that
                users and software developers are unrestricted by concerns about infringing on
                intellectual property rights. The idea is to let chess programmers compete in a
                free market where customers may choose software based on their real needs and
                not based on artificial requirements created by a secret data format.</P></LI>
            <LI>
              <P>The system must work for a variety of programs. The format
                should be such that it can be used by chess database programs, chess publishing
                programs, chess server programs, and chessplaying programs without being
                unnecessarily specific to any particular application class.</P></LI>
            <LI>
              <P>The system must be easily expandable and scalable. The
                expansion ability must include handling data items that may not exist currently
                but could be expected to emerge in the future. (Examples: new opening
                classifications and new country names.) The system should be scalable in that
                it must not have any arbitrary restrictions concerning the quantity of stored
                data. Also, planned modes of expansion should either preserve earlier databases
                or at least allow for their automatic conversion.</P></LI>
            <LI>
              <P>The system must be international. Chess software users are
                found in many countries and the system should be free of difficulties caused by
                conventions local to a given region.</P></LI>
            <LI>
              <P>Finally, the system should handle the same kinds and amounts
                of data that are already handled by existing chess software and by print

        <H1><A NAME="c3">3: Formats: import and export</A></H1>
        <P>There are two formats in the PGN specification. These are the
          "import" format and the "export" format. These are the two different ways of
          formatting the same PGN data according to its source. The details of the two
          formats are described throughout the following sections of this document.</P>
        <P>Other than formats, there is the additional topic of PGN
          presentation. While both PGN import and export formats are designed to be
          readable by humans, there is no recommendation that either of these be an
          ultimate mode of chess data presentation. Rather, software developers are urged
          to consider all of the various techniques at their disposal to enhance the
          display of chess data at the presentation level (i.e., highest level) of their
          programs. This means that the use of different fonts, character sizes, color,
          and other tools of computer aided interaction and publishing should be explored
          to provide a high quality presentation appropriate to the function of the
          particular program.</P>

            manually prepared data</A></H1>
          <P>The import format is rather flexible and is used to describe data
            that may have been prepared by hand, much like a source file for a high level
            programming language. A program that can read PGN data should be able to handle
            the somewhat lax import format.</P></DIV>

            generated output</A></H1>
          <P>The export format is rather strict and is used to describe data
            that is usually prepared under program control, something like a pretty printed
            source program reformatted by a compiler.</P>
          <DIV CLASS="sect2"><HR>
            <H2 CLASS="sect2"><A NAME="c3.2.1">3.2.1: Byte equivalence</A></H2>
            <P>For a given PGN data file, export format representations
              generated by different PGN programs on the same computing system should be
              exactly equivalent, byte for byte.</P></DIV>

            <H2 CLASS="sect2"><A NAME="c3.2.2">3.2.2: Archival storage and the
              newline character</A></H2>
            <P>Export format should also be used for archival storage. Here,
              "archival" storage is defined as storage that may be accessed by a variety of
              computing systems. The only extra requirement for archival storage is that the
              newline character have a specific representation that is independent of its
              value for a particular computing system's text file usage. The archival
              representation of a newline is the ASCII control character LF (line feed,
              decimal value 10, hexadecimal value 0x0a).</P>
            <P>Sadly, there are some accidents of history that survive to this
              day that have baroque representations for a newline: multicharacter sequences,
              end-of-line record markers, start-of-line byte counts, fixed length records,
              and so forth. It is well beyond the scope of the PGN project to reconcile all
              of these to the unified world of ANSI C and the those enjoying the bliss of a
              single '\n' convention. Some systems may just not be able to handle an archival
              PGN text file with native text editors. In these cases, an indulgence of sorts
              is granted to use the local newline convention in non-archival PGN files for
              those text editors.</P></DIV>

            <H2 CLASS="sect2"><A NAME="c3.2.3">3.2.3: Speed of
              processing</A></H2>
            <P>Several parts of the export format deal with exact descriptions
              of line and field justification that are absent from the import format details.
              The main reason for these restrictions on the export format are to allow the
              construction of simple data translation programs that can easily scan PGN data
              without having to have a full chess engine or other complex parsing routines.
              The idea is to encourage chess software authors to always allow for at least a
              limited PGN reading capability. Even when a full chess engine parsing
              capability is available, it is likely to be at least two orders of magnitude
              slower than a simple text scanner.</P></DIV>

            <P>A PGN game represented using export format is said to be in
              "reduced export format" if all of the following hold: 1) it has no commentary,
              2) it has only the standard seven tag roster identification information ("STR",
              see below), 3) it has no recursive annotation variations ("RAV", see below),
              and 4) it has no numeric annotation glyphs ("NAG", see below). Reduced export
              format is used for bulk storage of unannotated games. It represents a minimum

          <H1 CLASS="sect1"><A NAME="c4.1">4.1: Character codes</A></H1>
          <P>PGN data is represented using a subset of the eight bit ISO 8859/1
            (Latin 1) character set. ("ISO" is an acronym for the International Standards
            Organization.) This set is also known as ECMA-94 and is similar to other ISO
            Latin character sets. ISO 8859/1 includes the standard seven bit ASCII
            character set for the 32 control character code values from zero to 31. The 95
            printing character code values from 32 to 126 are also equivalent to seven bit
            ASCII usage. (Code value 127, the ASCII DEL control character, is a graphic
            character in ISO 8859/1; it is not used for PGN data representation.)</P>
          <P>The 32 ISO 8859/1 code values from 128 to 159 are non-printing
            control characters. They are not used for PGN data representation. The 32 code
            values from 160 to 191 are mostly non-alphabetic printing characters and their
            use for PGN data is discouraged as their graphic representation varies
            considerably among other ISO Latin sets. Finally, the 64 code values from 192
            to 255 are mostly alphabetic printing characters with various diacritical
            marks; their use is encouraged for those languages that require such
            characters. The graphic representations of this last set of 64 characters is
            fairly constant for the ISO Latin family.</P>
          <P>Printing character codes outside of the seven bit ASCII range may
            only appear in string data and in commentary. They are not permitted for use in
            symbol construction.</P>
          <P>Because some PGN users' environments may not support presentation
            of non-ASCII characters, PGN game authors should refrain from using such
            characters in critical commentary or string values in game data that may be
            referenced in such environments. PGN software authors should have their
            programs handle such environments by displaying a question mark ("?") for
            non-ASCII character codes. This is an important point because there are many
            computing systems that can display eight bit character data, but the display
            graphics may differ among machines and operating systems from different
            manufacturers.</P>
          <P>Only four of the ASCII control characters are permitted in PGN
            import format; these are the horizontal and vertical tabs along with the
            linefeed and carriage return codes.</P>
          <P>The external representation of the newline character may differ
            among platforms; this is an acceptable variation as long as the details of the
            implementation are hidden from software implementors and users. When a choice
            is practical, the Unix "newline is linefeed" convention is preferred.</P></DIV>

          <H1 CLASS="sect1"><A NAME="c4.2">4.2: Tab characters</A></H1>
          <P>Tab characters, both horizontal and vertical, are not permitted in
            the export format. This is because the treatment of tab characters is highly
            dependent upon the particular software in use on the host computing system.
            Also, tab characters may not appear inside of string data.</P></DIV>

          <P>PGN data are organized as simple text lines without any special
            bytes or markers for secondary record structure imposed by specific operating
            systems. Import format PGN text lines are limited to having a maximum of 255
            characters per line including the newline character. Lines with 80 or more
            printing characters are strongly discouraged because of the difficulties
            experienced by common text editors with long lines.</P>
          <P>In some cases, very long tag values will require 80 or more
            columns, but these are relatively rare. An example of this is the "FEN" tag
            pair; it may have a long tag value, but this particular tag pair is only used
            to represent a game that doesn't start from the usual initial

        <P>Comment text may appear in PGN data. There are two kinds of

          starts with a semicolon character and continues to the end of the line. The
          second kind starts with a left brace character and continues to the next right

        <P>Brace comments do not nest; a left brace character appearing in a
          brace comment loses its special meaning and is ignored. A semicolon appearing

          scanning software. This escape convention is intended for the private use of

          streams.</P>
        <P>A percent sign appearing in any other place other than the first

        <P>PGN character data is organized as tokens. A token is a contiguous

          separated from adjacent tokens by white space characters. (White space
          characters include space, newline, and tab characters.) Some tokens are self
          delimiting and do not require white space characters.</P>
        <P>A string token is a sequence of zero or more printing characters
          delimited by a pair of quote characters (ASCII decimal value 34, hexadecimal
          value 0x22). An empty string is represented by two adjacent quotes. (Note: an
          apostrophe is not a quote.) A quote inside a string is represented by the
          backslash immediately followed by a quote. A backslash inside a string is
          represented by two adjacent backslashes. Strings are commonly used as tag pair
          values (see below). Non-printing characters like newline and tab are not
          permitted inside of strings. A string token is terminated by its closing quote.
          Currently, a string is limited to a maximum of 255 characters of data.</P>
        <P>An integer token is a sequence of one or more decimal digit
          characters. It is a special case of the more general "symbol" token class
          described below. Integer tokens are used to help represent move number
          indications (see below). An integer token is terminated just prior to the first
          non-symbol character following the integer digit sequence.</P>
        <P>A period character (".") is a token by itself. It is used for move
          number indications (see below). It is self terminating.</P>
        <P>An asterisk character ("*") is a token by itself. It is used as one
          of the possible game termination markers (see below); it indicates an
          incomplete game or a game with an unknown or otherwise unavailable result. It
          is self terminating.</P>
        <P>The left and right bracket characters ("[" and "]") are tokens. They
          are used to delimit tag pairs (see below). Both are self terminating.</P>
        <P>The left and right parenthesis characters ("(" and ")") are tokens.
          They are used to delimit Recursive Annotation Variations (see below). Both are
          self terminating.</P>
        <P>The left and right angle bracket characters ("&lt;" and "&gt;") are
          tokens. They are reserved for future expansion. Both are self terminating.</P>
        <P>A Numeric Annotation Glyph ("NAG", see below) is a token; it is
          composed of a dollar sign character ("$") immediately followed by one or more
          digit characters. It is terminated just prior to the first non-digit character
          following the digit sequence.</P>
        <P>A symbol token starts with a letter or digit character and is
          immediately followed by a sequence of zero or more symbol continuation
          characters. These continuation characters are letter characters ("A-Za-z"),
          digit characters ("0-9"), the underscore ("_"), the plus sign ("+"), the
          octothorpe sign ("#"), the equal sign ("="), the colon (":"), and the hyphen
          ("-"). Symbols are used for a variety of purposes. All characters in a symbol
          are significant. A symbol token is terminated just prior to the first
          non-symbol character following the symbol character sequence. Currently, a
          symbol is limited to a maximum of 255 characters in length.</P></DIV>

        <P>A PGN database file is a sequential collection of zero or more PGN
          games. An empty file is a valid, although somewhat uninformative, PGN
          database.</P>
        <P>A PGN game is composed of two sections. The first is the tag pair
          section and the second is the movetext section. The tag pair section provides
          information that identifies the game by defining the values associated with a
          set of standard parameters. The movetext section gives the usually enumerated
          and possibly annotated moves of the game along with the concluding game
          termination marker. The chess moves themselves are represented using SAN
          (Standard Algebraic Notation), also described later in this document.</P>
        <DIV CLASS="sect1"><HR>
          <H1 CLASS="sect1"><A NAME="c8.1">8.1: Tag pair section</A></H1>
          <P>The tag pair section is composed of a series of zero or more tag
            pairs.</P>
          <P>A tag pair is composed of four consecutive tokens: a left bracket
            token, a symbol token, a string token, and a right bracket token. The symbol
            token is the tag name and the string token is the tag value associated with the
            tag name. (There is a standard set of tag names and semantics described below.)
            The same tag name should not appear more than once in a tag pair section.</P>
          <P>A further restriction on tag names is that they are composed
            exclusively of letters, digits, and the underscore character. This is done to
            facilitate mapping of tag names into key and attribute names for use with
            general purpose database programs.</P>
          <P>For PGN import format, there may be zero or more white space
            characters between any adjacent pair of tokens in a tag pair.</P>
          <P>For PGN export format, there are no white space characters between
            the left bracket and the tag name, there are no white space characters between
            the tag value and the right bracket, and there is a single space character
            between the tag name and the tag value.</P>
          <P>Tag names, like all symbols, are case sensitive. All tag names
            used for archival storage begin with an upper case letter.</P>
          <P>PGN import format may have multiple tag pairs on the same line and
            may even have a tag pair spanning more than a single line. Export format
            requires each tag pair to appear left justified on a line by itself; a single
            empty line follows the last tag pair.</P>
          <P>Some tag values may be composed of a sequence of items. For
            example, a consultation game may have more than one player for a given side.
            When this occurs, the single character ":" (colon) appears between adjacent
            items. Because of this use as an internal separator in strings, the colon
            should not otherwise appear in a string.</P>
          <P>The tag pair format is designed for expansion; initially only
            strings are allowed as tag pair values. Tag value formats associated with the
            STR (Seven Tag Roster, see below) will not change; they will always be string
            values. However, there are long term plans to allow general list structures as
            tag values for non-STR tag pairs. Use of these expanded tag values will likely
            be restricted to special research programs. In all events, the top level
            structure of a tag pair remains the same: left bracket, tag name, tag value,
            and right bracket.</P>
          <DIV CLASS="sect2"><HR>
            <H2 CLASS="sect2"><A NAME="c8.1.1">8.1.1: Seven Tag Roster</A></H2>
            <P>There is a set of tags defined for mandatory use for archival
              storage of PGN data. This is the STR (Seven Tag Roster). The interpretation of
              these tags is fixed as is the order in which they appear. Although the
              definition and use of additional tag names and semantics is permitted and
              encouraged when needed, the STR is the common ground that all programs should
              follow for public data interchange.</P>
            <P>For import format, the order of tag pairs is not important. For
              export format, the STR tag pairs appear before any other tag pairs. (The STR
              tag pairs must also appear in order; this order is described below). Also for
              export format, any additional tag pairs appear in ASCII order by tag name.</P>

              appears to be the most widely recognized.</P>
            <P>An alternative to SAN is FAN (Figurine Algebraic Notation). FAN

                  <P>Second (when the first step fails), if the moving pieces

                <LI>
                  <P>Third (when both the first and the second steps fail), the

              <P>Note that the above disambiguation is needed only to

                attack square e2, and if both could legally move there, then a file
                disambiguation is needed; the (nonchecking) knight moves would be "Nce2" and

            <P>This uses a list of one or more time control fields. Each field
              contains a descriptor for each time control period; if more than one descriptor
              is present then they are separated by the colon character (":"). The
              descriptors appear in the order in which they are used in the game. The last
              field appearing is considered to be implicitly repeated for further control
              periods as needed.</P>
            <P>There are six kinds of TimeControl fields.</P>
            <P></P>
            <UL>
              <LI>
                <P>The first kind is a single question mark ("?") which means
                  that the time control mode is unknown. When used, it is usually the only
                  descriptor present.</P></LI>
              <LI>
                <P>The second kind is a single hyphen ("-") which means that
                  there was no time control mode in use. When used, it is usually the only
                  descriptor present.</P></LI>
              <LI>
                <P>The third Time control field kind is formed as two positive
                  integers separated by a solidus ("/") character. The first integer is the
                  number of moves in the period and the second is the number of seconds in the
                  period. Thus, a time control period of 40 moves in 2 1/2 hours would be
                  represented as "40/9000".</P></LI>
              <LI>
                <P>The fourth TimeControl field kind is used for a "sudden
                  death" control period. It should only be used for the last descriptor in a
                  TimeControl tag value. It is sometimes the only descriptor present. The format
                  consists of a single integer that gives the number of seconds in the period.
                  Thus, a blitz game would be represented with a TimeControl tag value of
                  "300".</P></LI>
              <LI>
                <P>The fifth TimeControl field kind is used for an
                  "incremental" control period. It should only be used for the last descriptor in
                  a TimeControl tag value and is usually the only descriptor in the value. The
                  format consists of two positive integers separated by a plus sign ("+")
                  character. The first integer gives the minimum number of seconds allocated for
                  the period and the second integer gives the number of extra seconds added after
                  each move is made. So, an incremental time control of 90 minutes plus one extra
                  minute per move would be given by "4500+60" in the TimeControl tag
                  value.</P></LI>
              <LI>
                <P>The sixth TimeControl field kind is used for a "sandclock"
                  or "hourglass" control period. It should only be used for the last descriptor
                  in a TimeControl tag value and is usually the only descriptor in the value. The
                  format consists of an asterisk ("*") immediately followed by a positive
                  integer. The integer gives the total number of seconds in the sandclock period.
                  The time control is implemented as if a sandclock were set at the start of the
                  period with an equal amount of sand in each of the two chambers and the players
                  invert the sandclock after each move with a time forfeit indicated by an empty
                  upper chamber. Electronic implementation of a physical sandclock may be used.
                  An example sandclock specification for a common three minute egg timer
                  sandclock would have a tag value of "*180".</P></LI>

          <P>PGN data files used for chronologically ordered (oldest first)

          presented in rough chronological order of their being made known to the PGN
          standard coordinator. Authors of PGN capable software are encouraged to contact
          the coordinator (e-mail address listed near the start of this document) so that
          the information may be included here in this section.</P>
        <P>In addition to the PGN standard, there are two more chess standards
          of interest to the chess software community. These are the FEN standard
          (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) for position notation and the EPD standard (Extended
          Position Description) for comprehensive position description for automated
          interprogram processing. These are described in a later section of this
          document.</P>
        <P>Some PGN software is freeware and can be gotten from ftp sites and
          other sources. Other PGN software is payware and appears as part of commercial
          chessplaying programs and chess database managers. Those who are interested in
          the propagation of the PGN standard are encouraged to support manufacturers of
          chess software that use the standard. If a particular vendor does not offer PGN
          compatibility, it is likely that a few letters to them along with a copy of
          this specification may help them decide to include PGN support in their next
          release.</P>
        <P>The staff at the University of Oklahoma at Norman (USA) have
          graciously provided an ftp site (chess.uoknor.edu) for the storage of chess
          related data and programs. Because file names change over time, those accessing
          the site are encouraged to first retrieve the file "pub/chess/ls-lR.gz" for a
          current listing. A scan of this listing will also help locate versions of PGN
          programs for machine types and operating systems other than those listed below.

          <P>The MS-DOS edition of the multifunction commercial program BOOKUP,
            version 8.1, is able to use the EPD standard for communication with other EPD
            capable programs. It may also be PGN capable as well.</P>
          <P>The BOOKUP 8.1.1 Addenda notes dated 1993.12.17 provide
            comprehensive information on how to use EPD in conjunction with "analyst"
            programs such as Zarkov and HIARCS. Specifically, the search and evaluation
            abilities of an analyst program are combined with the information organization
            abilities of the BOOKUP database program to provide position scoring. This is
            done by first having BOOKUP export a database in EPD format, then having an
            analyst program annotate each EPD record with a numeric score, and then having
            BOOKUP import the changed EPD file. BOOKUP can then apply minimaxing to the
            imported database; this results in scores from terminal positions being
            propagated back to earlier positions and even back to moves from the starting
            array.</P>
          <P>For some reason, BOOKUP calls this process "backsolving", but it's
            really just standard minimaxing. In any case, it's a good example of how
            different programs from different authors performing different types of tasks
            can be integrated by use of a common, non-proprietary standard. This allows for
            a new set of powerful features that are beyond the capabilities of any one of
            the individual component programs.</P>
          <P>BOOKUP allows for some customizing of EPD actions. One such
            customization is to require the positional evaluations to follow the EPD
            standard; this means that the score is always given from the viewpoint of the
            active player. This is explained more fully in the section on the "ce"
            (centipawn evaluation) opcode in the EPD description in a later section of this
            document. To ensure that BOOKUP handles the centipawn evaluations in the
            "right" way, the EPD setting "Positive for White" must be set to "N". This
            makes BOOKUP work correctly with Zarkov and with all other programs that use
            the "right" centipawn evaluation convention. There is an apparent problem with
            HIARCS that requires this option to be set to "Y"; but this really means that,
            if true, HIARCS needs to be adjusted to use the "right" centipawn evaluation
            convention.</P>

            chess positions using the ASCII character set.</P>
          <P>A single FEN record uses one text line of variable length composed
            of six data fields. The first four fields of the FEN specification are the same
            as the first four fields of the EPD specification.</P>
          <P>A text file composed exclusively of FEN data records should have a

            <P>FEN is based on a 19th century standard for position recording
              designed by the Scotsman David Forsyth, a newspaper journalist. The original
              Forsyth standard has been slightly extended for use with chess software by
              Steven Edwards with assistance from commentators on the Internet. This new
              standard, FEN, was first implemented in Edwards' SAN Kit.</P></DIV>

              notation</A></H2>
            <P>Having a standard position notation is particularly important
              for chess programmers as it allows them to share position databases. For
              example, there exist standard position notation databases with many of the
              classical benchmark tests for chessplaying programs, and by using a common
              position notation format many hours of tedious data entry can be saved.
              Additionally, a position notation can be useful for page layout programs and
              for confirming position status for e-mail competition.</P>

            <P>FEN specifies the piece placement, the active color, the
              castling availability, the en passant target square, the halfmove clock, and
              the fullmove number. These can all fit on a single text line in an easily read
              format. The length of a FEN position description varies somewhat according to
              the position. In some cases, the description could be eighty or more characters
              in length and so may not fit conveniently on some displays. However, these
              positions aren't too common.</P>

              <P>An opcode is an identifier that starts with a letter character
                and may be followed by up to fourteen more characters. Each additional

              <P>An operand is either a set of contiguous non-white space
                printing characters or a string. A string is a set of contiguous printing

                less than 256 bytes of data.</P>
              <P>If at least one operand is present in an operation, there is a
                single space between the opcode and the first operand. If more than one operand
                is present in an operation, there is a single blank character between every two
                adjacent operands. If there are no operands, a semicolon character is appended
                to the opcode to mark the end of the operation. If any operands appear, the
                last operand has an appended semicolon that marks the end of the operation.</P>
              <P>Any given opcode appears at most once per EPD record. Multiple
                operations in a single EPD record should appear in ASCII order of their opcode
                names (mnemonics). However, a program reading EPD records may allow for

              <P>Some opcodes that allow for more than one operand may have
                special ordering requirements for the operands. For example, the "pv"
                (predicted variation) opcode requires its operands (moves) to appear in the
                order in which they would be played. All other opcodes that allow for more than
                one operand should have operands appearing in ASCII order. An example of the
                latter set is the "bm" (best move[s]) opcode; its operands are moves that are
                all immediately playable from the current position.</P>
              <P>Some opcodes require one or more operands that are chess
                moves. These moves should be represented using SAN. If a different
                representation is used, there is no guarantee that the EPD will be read
                correctly during subsequent processing.</P>
              <P>Some opcodes require one or more operands that are integers.
                Some opcodes may require that an integer operand must be within a given range;
                the details are described in the opcode list given below. A negative integer is
                formed with a hyphen (minus sign) preceding the integer digit sequence. An
                optional plus sign may be used for indicating a non-negative value, but such

              <P>Some opcodes require one or more operands that are floating
                point numbers. Some opcodes may require that a floating point operand must be
                within a given range; the details are described in the opcode list given below.
                A floating point operand is constructed from an optional sign character ("+" or

                active player; i.e., the player with the move. Positive values indicate a

                Thus, a losing mate in N fullmoves is a mate in (2 * N) halfmoves (or ply) and
                has a corresponding centipawn evaluation of (-32767 + (2 * N)). For example, a

        <P>The binary coded version of PGN is PGC (PGN Game Coding). PGC is a
          binary representation standard of PGN data designed for the dual goals of
          storage efficiency and program I/O. A file containing PGC data should have a
          name with a suffix of ".pgc".</P>
        <P>Unlike PGN text files that may have locale dependent representations
          for newlines, PGC files have data that does not vary due to local processing
          environment. This means that PGC files may be transferred among systems using
          general binary file methods.</P>
        <P>PGC files should be used only when the use of PGN is impractical due
          to time and space resource constraints. As the general level of processing
          capabilities increases, the need for PGC over PGN will decrease. Therefore,
          implementors are encouraged not to use PGC as the default representation
          because it is much more difficult (than PGN) to understand without proper
          software.</P>
        <P>PGC data is composed of a sequence of PGC records. Each record is
          composed of a sequence of one or more bytes. The first byte is the PGN record
          marker and it specifies the interpretation of the remaining portion of the
          record. This remaining portion is composed of zero or more PGN record items.
          Item types include move sequences, move sets, and character strings.</P>

          <P>At the lowest level, PGC binary data is organized as bytes, words
            (two contiguous bytes), and doublewords (four contiguous bytes). All eight bits
            of a byte are used. Longwords (eight contiguous bytes) are not used. Integer
            values are stored using two's complement representation. Integers may be signed
            or unsigned depending on context. Multibyte integers are stored in low-endian
            format with the least significant byte appearing first.</P>
          <P>A one byte integer item is called "int-1". A two byte integer item
            is called "int-2". A four byte integer item is called "int-4".</P>
          <P>Characters are stored as bytes using the ISO 8859/1 Latin-1
            (ECMA-94) code set. There is no provision for other characters sets or

          <H1 CLASS="sect1"><A NAME="c20.2">20.2: Move ordinals</A></H1>
          <P>A chess move is represented using a move ordinal. This is a single
            unsigned byte quantity with values from zero to 255. A move ordinal is
            interpreted as an index into the list of legal moves from the current position.
            This list is constructed by generating the legal moves from the current
            position, assigning SAN ASCII strings to each move, and then sorting these
            strings in ascending order. Note that a seven bit ordinal, as used by some
            inferior representation systems, is insufficient as there are some positions
            that have more than 128 moves available.</P>
          <P>Examples: From the initial position, there are twenty moves. Move
            ordinal 0 corresponds to the SAN move string "Na3"; move ordinal 1 corresponds
            to "Nc3", move ordinal 4 corresponds to "a3", and move ordinal 19 corresponds
            to "h4".</P>
          <P>Moves can be organized into sequences and sets. A move sequence is
            an ordered list of moves that are played, one after another from first to last.
            A move set is a list of moves that are all playable from the current
            position.</P>
          <P>Move sequence data is represented using a length header followed
            by move ordinal data. The length header is an unsigned integer that may be a
            byte or a word. The integer gives the number, possibly zero, of following move
            ordinal bytes. Most move sequences can be represented using just a byte header;
            these are called "mvseq-1" items. Move sequence data using a word header are
            called "mvseq-2" items.</P>
          <P>Move set data is represented using a length header followed by
            move ordinal data. The length header is an unsigned integer that is a byte. The
            integer gives the number, possibly zero, of following move ordinal bytes. All
            move sets are be represented using just a byte header; these are called
            "mvset-1" items. (Note the implied restriction that a move set can only have a
            maximum of 255 of the possible 256 ordinals present at one time.)</P></DIV>

            bytes of character data. The length header is an unsigned integer that may be a
            byte, a word, or a doubleword. The integer gives the number, possibly zero, of
            following character bytes. Most strings can be represented using just a byte
            header; these are called "string-1" items. String data using a word header are

            "string-4" items. No special ASCII NUL termination byte is required for PGC
